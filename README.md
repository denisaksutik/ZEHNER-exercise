# ZEHNER exercise
## Overview
This is a single page website created using Node.js and Express.js
I used Node + express.js for this project because it's easy to configure and customize.
I didn't use express-generator for this exercise, instead I just created everything by myself that allowed me to avoid extra files generated from generator.

I spent 4 hours working on this project. During that time I was able to create fully functional and responsive header navigation and the section down below.
In my opinion header was the hardest part in this exercise because it has different states depending on the screen's resolutuion.
If I had more time I would sort sass files in more detailed way ðŸ‘Œ

## Installation required
Node.js Or NPM (Node Package Manager)

## Run a project

## NOTE
While working in Figma I also noticed that the site is not following consistent standards for example different spacing between icons.
Another room for improvemnt is in the way of adding pictures: currently the pictures of different sizes are uploaded and then "altered" with frames.
I think there is a pleanty of ways to make this design cleaner ðŸ™ƒ
